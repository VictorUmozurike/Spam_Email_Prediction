Context: This is a project worked on by me, a classmate and a personal teacher on learning how to collect data from a file via a simple classification model. Like in the name, it's main function is to take in simple excel files of mail data, specifically mail data that's already been seperated between spam mail and ham (real) mail, then we use our code to seperate and experiment with them using the train-test-method. The intention after this was to learn how to do more complex classification and regression modes.

Usage: 
Import the Mai_Data.csv
Run All 
change around parameters to gin different amounts of spam/ham mail

Net Steps/Growth: I plan to create a regression model version of my spam mail checker, specifically by myself with a little help from AI (Chat GPT), as well as using a data_model with more factors like "Sender", "recepient", dates of mail, it being unspecified if it's spam or ham like this data set, and etc.
